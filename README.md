# FUTURE PLANES & UPDATES
#### I have limited time to submit this project, but I plan to add more features in future updates. For instance, I will soon include the ability to predict the age of a person in an image. Additionally, users will be able to upload CCTV footage and multiple images of the same person from different angles. This tool will then detect the presence of the person in the CCTV footage and record the time frames in which the person is detected. This feature could significantly help  police officers  by saving them the time required to manually watch and investigate CCTV footage. They can simply run this tool in the background.

### 1.	This tool can be used to check missing people by comparing their last known face with evidence images, such as CCTV footage screenshots or images from any other source online
*Quality of the CCTV footage could impact the result!

### 2.	This tool checks the person's unique facial features, such as the shape of the nose, eyes, and other distinctive characteristics, compare persons face. This capability allows the tool to find a person even if they have aged or their appearance has changed since the last available image of them.

### 3.	This tool allows users to operate offline on their systems, ensuring the privacy of investigative data, especially when searching for missing persons. Users can conduct investigations without needing to share evidence such as CCTV footage images related to missing persons with third-party web services, thereby maintaining confidentiality.

# Project Description:
Face_checker.io is a tool designed to compare two images and analyze their unique facial features to determine if they belong to the same individual, even if the images depict the person at different ages.

# Problem Statement Addressed:
In many cases of missing persons or disaster recovery, time can significantly alter appearances, making manual identification difficult. This tool utilizes advanced facial recognition to bridge the gap, aiding law enforcement and humanitarian agencies in locating individuals.

# Key Features to Highlight:

1) Advanced Facial Recognition:

* High accuracy in comparing aged or altered photos for reliable results.

2) Missing Persons Identification:

* Designed to assist in reuniting families and solving cold cases by matching current images with older photographs.

3) Privacy-Oriented:
* Ensures secure and ethical handling of all uploaded images to prioritize user trust.

# Use Cases for Public Safety:

1) Locating Missing Individuals:

* Aid law enforcement agencies in comparing aged photos of missing people with recent surveillance or recovered images.

2) Disaster Victim Identification (DVI):

* In disaster recovery efforts, compare available pre-disaster images with unidentified victims to aid identification.

3) Reuniting Families:

* Help NGOs and agencies identify separated children or family members in humanitarian crises.
